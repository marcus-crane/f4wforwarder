# F4W Forwarder

This is a little [hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) server that reserves [Dave Meltzer](https://twitter.com/davemeltzerWON)'s famous [Wrestling Observer Radio](http://www.f4wonline.com/radioshow-archive)

# What is this, like a piracy thing?

Nope! The WON radio requires you to have an active subscription to listen to (and I have one) but unfortunately, a lot of podcasting apps don't support authenticated/private streams.

I normally use [Pocket Casts](https://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) but they don't support, nor plan to support, private streams. I tried a couple of others which worked fine but either had ugly or ad riddled UI (or both!)

Fed up with my options, I realised that since the mp3s themselves are just streams, I can just have a small server do the authentication server side rather than being bugged on the client side giving the illusion of a public podcast and letting me go back to Pocket Casts.

# But aren't you distributing this meaning others can steal Dave's stuff?

Not at all! This code is for personal use only and you need an account anyway if you want to run it yourself. His streams are uploaded to YouTube often but if you enjoy his work, you should support him and the F4W team with a subscription. They're not even that expensive considering how much content they churn out weekly.

# Will I be sports entertained after using this code?

Why aren't you watching the G1 Climax instead of reading this? I swear to god, Dave better not have a heart attack after Omega x Okada 3
