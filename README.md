# F4W Forwarder

This is a little [hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) server that re-serves [Dave Meltzer](https://twitter.com/davemeltzerWON)'s famous [Wrestling Observer Radio](http://www.f4wonline.com/radioshow-archive).

# What is this, like a piracy thing?

Nope! WOR requires you to have an active subscription to listen to but unfortunately, a lot of podcasting apps don't support authenticated/private streams.

I normally use [Pocket Casts](https://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) but they don't support, nor plan to support, private streams. I tried a couple of others which worked fine but either had ugly or ad riddled UI or both!

Fed up with having to trade UI for functionality, it kinda clicked the other day that, and it sounds obvious saying it out loud, but that the podcast files are just streams of audio!

Why not just have a small server do the authentication server side, pipe the audio and re-serve it so that Pocket Casts can access it, duh. So yeah, that's what this is ðŸ˜Ž

# But aren't you distributing this meaning others can steal Dave's stuff?

Not at all! This code is for personal use only and you need an account anyway if you want to run it yourself. The streams are uploaded to YouTube unofficially so if you enjoy his work, you should support him and the F4W team with a subscription. They're not even that expensive considering how much content they churn out weekly.

# How do I use it

First up, you'll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Either a `sudo apt-get install node` or a `brew install node` should set you up. If you're on Windows, uhh, I guess check out the [official website](https://nodejs.org/)?

You'll need to check that you're running v7.7.4 or above as this uses async/await

`node -v` will return your current version number.

Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in the placeholders. Here's an example:

```
DOMAIN=http://mycoolwebsite.com
USERNAME=davemeltzer
PASSWORD=supersecure123
```

Your username and password are combined and sent with the request because the actual audio files themselves require Basic Authorization (the popup prompt you get with things like routers) to access.

Once that's done, all you need to do is run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. You'll need to deploy it to a server for it to be useful outside of your own local network.

I'll assume you know how to figure that part out otherwise try looking into something like [Heroku](http://heroku.com)

# How do I use it (tl;dr)

```
brew install node / sudo apt-get install node
node -v (check that it's at least 7.7.4)
npm install
cp example.env -> .env
npm start
```

You'll need to deploy it to a server if you want to access files outside of your house. A Raspberry Pi + router forwarding would probably work perfectly.

# Will I be sports entertained after using this code?

Why aren't you watching the G1 Climax instead of reading this? I swear to god, Dave better not have a heart attack after Omega x Okada 3

P.S. Battleground sucked
